                                    Legumes (Fabaceae ) are used both as food grain seed and livestock forage and
                                    silage.
                                    Legumes is the only vegetable culture which has a valuable vegetable protein which
                                    can substitute an
                                    animal protein. Legumes are rich in vitamins and microelements such as folate,
                                    manganese, thiamin,
                                    magnesium, iron. That is why legumes are largely used in vegetarian diet.
                                    Ukrainian legumes are represented by beans, soybeans, peas, lentils, lupins etc.

                                    Grain is the most important vegetable plant in human history. In ancient times good
                                    grain harvest used
                                    to
                                    mean prosperity and happiness, while bad harvest of grains symbolized poverty and
                                    death.
                                    Ukraine is famous worldwide for its grain. Ukraine’s fertile soils, favorable
                                    climate conditions and
                                    cheap
                                    grain costs lead this country to the leaders of the world grain market. It is
                                    certain, that Ukraine
                                    does
                                    not use its full grain potential, so the harvest figures could be doubled in future
                                    in case of the
                                    improved management.
                                    Ukrainian grain is represented by wheat, rye, barley, millet, oats, buckwheat and
                                    others.
                                    The main problem of grain production in Ukraine is grain storage. Building new
                                    granaries and new
                                    transshipment complexes are among our primary plans
